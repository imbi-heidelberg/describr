# describr - publication quality descriptive tables with R

Tired of fiddling with boring 'univariat descriptive tables' that everybody (should) want but nobody wants to do - `describr` (hopefully) resolves this issue and makes generating nice-looking descriptive tables (almost) fun!

## Installation

Make sure that the `devtools` package is installed and run

    devtools::install_github('kkmann/describr')
    
to install the newest release. 

## Intro

There is currently zero documentation (which limits practical usability ;) ) but if you want to play around, check out https://github.com/kkmann/describr/blob/master/inst/test.R
